As an IT Web Programming graduate and frontend enthusiast, I am passionate about combining creativity and functionality to deliver stunning results.

Did my first website consist of a single HTML page about cats with brutal inline styling and major Microsoft PowerPoint from 1991 vibes? Why yes, it did. Since that first attempt, Iâ€™ve developed my full stack capabilities, sharpened my communication and design skills, improved time management to prioritize tasks effectively, and cultivated problem-solving abilities while knowing when to seek help. In 18 of the 25 courses I took I earned a grade of 98, 99, or 100 percent. Collaboration and empathy are central to my work, enabling me to connect effectively with clients and teams.

Whether debugging JavaScript or creating pixel perfect responsive designs, I've embraced the continuous learning that is essential to a career in IT
